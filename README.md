Diccionarios - read multiple Greek and Latin dictionaries at the same time
==========================================================================

This item has been floating around for 10 years.  I've been asked to put it up here.

Installation
------------

Install the folder containing the exe somewhere
Create underneath it a folder "Diccionarios"
Inside that, install all the rar dictionary files.  Each contains a book in pages.

So:

c:\program files\Diccionarios2020\Diccionarios\Glare
c:\program files\Diccionarios2020\Diccionarios\Liddel-Scott

etc

Source code
-----------

The source code is about a year older than the release version, and various things do not work.  It's in VB.NET 2008.
